![](cover.png)

Minimal is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) interface replacement meticulously designed to feel native on desktop, mobile and tablet. You can customize colors, fonts and more with the companion plugins [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) and [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider).

## Features

The following features can be accessed using [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) plugin or Style Settings plugin (see companion plugins instructions below)

- Background styles for light and dark mode, including true black ideal for OLED devices
- Focus mode — hides everything but the text when sidebars are collapsed
- Custom icons
- Fancy cursor — uses accent color for the cursor
- Hide sidebar borders
- Trim filenames
- Cursor options
- Click and hold to expand images

## Installation

- Open Obsidian Settings
- Go to `Appearance` and click `Manage`
- Under community themes search for Minimal and click `Use`

## Companion plugins

To customize Minimal, install the [Minimal Theme Settings plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) or [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). Minimal Theme Settings is best if you want to use [hotkeys](#hotkeys), while Style Settings has more granular settings for headings and advanced features. Note that running both simultaneously may lead to conflicts.

The [Hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) is also recommended to hide UI elements. When using Hider to turn off the app ribbon, it can be accessed by hovering over the bottom left edge of the window.

In addition [Contextual Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-contextual-typography) is highly recommended, and required for all advanced layout features such as image grids and block width options.

## Plugin support

Most plugins work well with Minimal, but the following plugins have received special love and attention:

- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)

## Helper classes and filters

Additional documentation can be found at [publish.obsdian.md/kepano](https://publish.obsidian.md/kepano)

## Image filters

Image filters can be added to create the following effects. Use them by adding the filter name at the end of the image link, e.g. `![[image.jpeg#invert]]`

| Filter    | Description                                                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#invert` | Invert images in dark mode — ideal for charts and handwriting |
| `#circle` | Crop image to a circle |

## CSS helper classes

CSS helper classes can be added on a per-file basis using the `cssClasses` [YAML front matter key](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter). These classes are composable, so you can include more than one to combine effects.

For example, use the following code at the top of your file to enable cards layout: 
```
---
cssClasses: cards
---
```

## Developers

### Contributing

If you would like add support for a plugin, or have found a bug you'd like to help fix, don't hesitate to open a pull request.

### Build instructions

**Set up**

```
sudo gem install sass
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```

**Define local path**

To build directly into your Obsidian vault rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update `OBSIDIAN_PATH` to the local path of your Obsidian theme folder.

**To run**

```
npx grunt
```

This builds two files, the `obsidian.css` distribution file (for the community themes store) which is minified and also copied to your vault for live reload, and the `Minimal.css` file which is an unminified copy saved to the project root.

### Distributing Minimal forks

Minimal is frequently updated to stay current with the latest version of Obsidian. To make it easy to stay current with the latest improvements, I recommend using [Github's fork feature](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) so that you can merge the latest changes into your fork.

## Disclaimer

This theme is provided as is, and is designed for my personal use of Obsidian on Mac OS. As such it is not thoroughly tested across all operating systems and use cases. 

This theme modifies significant parts of the Obsidian interface, so it may break with future updates. It may also be incompatible with other bits of custom CSS you have.
